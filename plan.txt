—May want to organize all day month, year schema into a User model. The user has a goal, badges, habits, etc.

A Habit
UserId: current_user.id
StartDate: Date
EndDate: Date (default is null)
Paused: Boolean
An array of habit completions for the time period:
[ { startTime: Date, endTime: Date, allComplete: Boolean,
Completion Array: [ {completed on: Date, pointValue: Number}, {completedOn: Date, pointValue: Number}, null, null, null ] },
{ Day: Date,
Completion Array: [ [{}] ] }
When we post a new completion for a habit, if there is not a day object create a new completion array for that day
